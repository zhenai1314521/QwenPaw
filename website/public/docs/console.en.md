# Console

The **Console** is QwenPaw's built-in web interface. After running `qwenpaw app`,
open `http://127.0.0.1:8088/` in your browser to enter the Console.

**In the Console, you can:**

- Chat with QwenPaw in real time
- Enable/disable/configure messaging channels
- View and manage all chat sessions
- Manage scheduled jobs and heartbeat
- Edit QwenPaw's persona and behavior files
- Enable/import skills to extend QwenPaw's capabilities
- Toggle tools on or off
- Manage MCP clients
- Modify runtime configuration
- Manage multiple agents
- Configure LLM providers and select models
- Manage environment variables required by tools
- Manage security options for tools and skills
- View LLM token usage statistics
- Configure how voice messages are handled

The sidebar on the left lists all features in four groups — **Chat**, **Control**,
**Workspace**, and **Settings**. Click an item to switch pages. The sections below
walk through each feature in order.

> **Not seeing the Console?** Make sure the frontend has been built. See
> [CLI](./cli).

## Chat

> Sidebar: **Chat → Chat**

This is where you talk to QwenPaw. It is the default page when the Console opens.

![Chat](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01EP1ra01iOAcBvF0TC_!!6000000004402-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

**Choose a model:**
Use the control at the **top-right** of the chat page to pick the model for the
current agent.

**Send a message:**
Type in the input box at the bottom, then press **Enter** or click the send
button (↑). QwenPaw replies in real time.

**Voice input:**
The composer supports **voice input** (browser and OS microphone permission
required). Behavior matches **Voice transcription** settings (e.g. transcribe
first, then send text to the model).

**Attachments:**
You can attach **files** such as documents, images, and audio/video (follow
on-screen limits; per-file size caps apply).

**Create a new session:**
Click the **New Chat** button at the top-right of the chat page to start a new
conversation. Each session keeps separate history.

**Switch sessions:**
Click the **Chat history** button at the top-right to view and switch between
past conversations.

**Delete a session:**
In the chat history panel, click the **trash** button on the right of a session
row to delete it.

---

## Channels

> Sidebar: **Control → Channels**

Manage messaging channels (Console, DingTalk, Feishu, Discord, QQ, WeChat,
iMessage, etc.): enable/disable and credentials.

![Channels](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01cqMycR1SeczjROAHu_!!6000000002272-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

**Enable a channel:**

1. Click the channel card you want to configure.
2. A settings panel slides out on the right. Turn on **Enable**.
3. Fill in required credentials — each channel differs; see [Channels](./channels).
4. Click **Save**. Changes take effect in seconds, no restart required.

**Disable a channel:**
Open the same panel, turn off **Enable**, then click **Save**.

> For credential setup details, see [Channels](./channels).

---

## Sessions

> Sidebar: **Control → Sessions**

View, filter, and clean up chat sessions across all channels.

![Sessions](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01PY9Yhe25Pl9TuEBfz_!!6000000007519-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

**Batch delete:**
Select rows → click **Batch Delete** → confirm.

## Cron Jobs

> Sidebar: **Control → Cron Jobs**

Create and manage scheduled jobs that QwenPaw runs automatically by time.

![Cron Jobs](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01WsQvrb1dKthp8QMvd_!!6000000003718-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

**Create a new job:**

> If the cron job fails to be created, please refer to the **Troubleshooting Scheduled (Cron) Tasks** section in the [FAQ](https://qwenpaw.agentscope.io/docs/faq) to identify the cause.

The **simplest way to create a cron job is to chat directly with QwenPaw** and let it handle the creation for you. For example, if you want to receive a reminder to drink water on DingTalk, simply message QwenPaw on DingTalk: "Help me create a cron job to remind me to drink water every 5 minutes." Once created, you can view the new task on the Cron Jobs page in the console.

Alternatively, you can create tasks directly via the Console interface:

1. Click **+ Create Job**.
2. Fill in each section:
   - **Basic info** — Job ID (e.g. `job-001`), display name (e.g. "Daily summary"),
     and enable the job.
   - **Schedule** — Pick a schedule; if presets are not enough, enter a **cron
     expression** (five fields, e.g. `0 9 * * *` = 9:00 daily). Timezone defaults
     to the current agent's user timezone; you can change it here.
   - **Task type & content** — **Text**: send fixed text from **Message content**.
     **Agent**: fill **Request content**; on each run QwenPaw receives the text
     from `content.text` as the request.
   - **Delivery** — Target channel (Console, DingTalk, etc.), target user,
     target session id, and mode (**Stream** = token stream, **Final** = one
     complete reply).
   - **Advanced** — Optional: max concurrency, timeout, misfire grace time.
3. Click **Save**.

**Enable/disable a job:**
Toggle the switch in the row.

**Edit a job:**
**Disable** the job first, click **Edit** → change fields → **Save**.

**Run once immediately:**
Click **Execute Now** → confirm.

**Delete a job:**
**Disable** the job first, click **Delete** → confirm.

## Heartbeat

> Sidebar: **Control → Heartbeat**

![Heartbeat](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/O1CN017fS5GW1jIxj8FuQXl_!!6000000004526-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

Configure periodic "self-check" for the **currently selected agent**: on each
tick, send the contents of `HEARTBEAT.md` as a user message to QwenPaw, and
optionally deliver the reply to a chosen target.

**Common options:**

- **Enable** — Must be on for the schedule to run.
- **Interval** — Number + unit (minutes / hours).
- **Delivery target** — `main` runs in the main session only; `last` can send
  results to the channel from your last user conversation.
- **Active hours** (optional) — Only fire within a daily window to avoid night
  noise.

Click **Save** to apply. See [Heartbeat](./heartbeat) for wording and semantics.

---

## Files

> Sidebar: **Workspace → Files**

Edit files that define QwenPaw's persona and behavior — `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
`HEARTBEAT.md`, etc. — directly in the browser.

> **Multi-agent:** Starting from **v0.1.0**, QwenPaw supports **multi-agent** mode.
> You can run multiple independent agents in one QwenPaw instance, each with its own
> workspace, configuration, memory, and history. Agents can collaborate. Use the
> switcher at the top of the Console to change the active agent. See
> [Multi-Agent](./multi-agent).

![Files](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01iEhSJL1cHP4JHPdio_!!6000000003575-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

**Edit files:**

1. Click a file in the list (e.g. `SOUL.md`).
2. The editor shows file content. Turn off preview if needed, then edit.
3. Click **Save** to apply, or **Reset** to discard and reload.

**View daily memory:**
If `MEMORY.md` exists, click the **▶** arrow to expand date-based entries. Click a
date to view or edit that day's memory.

**Download workspace:**
Click **Download** to export the entire workspace as a `.zip` to your machine.

**Upload/restore workspace:**
Click **Upload** → choose a `.zip` (max 100 MB). Existing workspace files will be
replaced. Useful for migration and backup restore.

## Voice transcription

Configure how **voice/audio from channels** is handled before it reaches the
model (same settings apply to voice input in chat and channel voice messages).

- **Audio mode** — **Auto**: transcribe per settings below, then send text
  (works for most models). **Native**: send audio as an attachment (only for
  models that support audio).
- **Transcription backend** — **Off**; **Whisper API** (OpenAI-compatible
  `audio/transcriptions`; configure keys under [Models](#models) and select the
  provider here); **Local Whisper** (requires `ffmpeg` and
  `pip install 'qwenpaw[whisper]'`).

**Save** applies to newly received audio. Follow on-page help for details.
