# Magic Commands

Magic commands are special instructions prefixed with `/` that let you **directly control conversation state** without waiting for the AI to interpret your intent.

---

## Conversation Management Commands

Commands for controlling conversation context.

| Command    | Wait   | Compressed Summary | Long-term Memory   | Response Content              |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `/compact` | ⏳ Yes | 📦 Generate new    | ✅ Background save | ✅ Compact complete + Summary |
| `/new`     | ⚡ No  | 🗑️ Clear           | ✅ Background save | ✅ New conversation prompt    |
| `/clear`   | ⚡ No  | 🗑️ Clear           | ❌ No save         | ✅ History cleared prompt     |

---

### /compact - Compress Current Conversation

Manually trigger conversation compaction, condensing all current messages into a summary (**requires waiting**), while saving to long-term memory in the background.

```
/compact
```

Optionally, add an extra instruction to guide what the summary should keep or remove:

```
/compact keep requirements, decisions, and pending tasks; remove debug logs and tool-call details
```

**Example response:**

```
**Compact Complete!**

- Messages compacted: 12
**Compressed Summary:**
User requested help building a user authentication system, login endpoint implementation completed...
- Summary task started in background
```

> 💡 Unlike auto-compaction, `/compact` compresses **all** current messages, not just the portion exceeding the threshold.
> 💡 The extra instruction only applies to this manual `/compact` run. Auto-compaction behavior is unchanged.

---

### /new - Clear Context and Save Memory

**Immediately clear the current context** and start a fresh conversation. History is saved to long-term memory in the background.

```
/new
```

**Example response:**

```
**New Conversation Started!**

- Summary task started in background
- Ready for new conversation
```

---

### /clear - Clear Context (Without Saving Memory)

**Immediately clear the current context**, including message history and compressed summaries. Nothing is saved to long-term memory.

```
/clear
```

**Example response:**

```
**History Cleared!**

- Compressed summary reset
- Memory is now empty
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**: `/clear` is **irreversible**! Unlike `/new`, cleared content will not be saved.

---

## Conversation Debugging Commands

Commands for viewing and managing conversation history.

| Command             | Response Content              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `/history`          | 📋 Message list + Token stats |
| `/message`          | 📄 Specified message details  |
| `/compact_str`      | 📝 Compressed summary content |
| `/summarize_status` | 📊 Summary task status        |
| `/dump_history`     | 📁 Exported history file path |
| `/load_history`     | ✅ History load result        |

---

### /history - View Current Conversation History

Display a list of all uncompressed messages in the current conversation, along with detailed **context usage information**.

```
/history
```

**Example response:**

```
**Conversation History**

- Total messages: 3
- Estimated tokens: 1256
- Max input length: 128000
- Context usage: 0.98%
- Compressed summary tokens: 128

[1] **user** (text_tokens=42)
    content: [text(tokens=42)]
    preview: Write me a Python function...

[2] **assistant** (text_tokens=256)
    content: [text(tokens=256)]
    preview: Sure, let me write a function for you...

[3] **user** (text_tokens=28)
    content: [text(tokens=28)]
    preview: Can you add error handling?

---

- Use /message <index> to view full message content
- Use /compact_str to view full compact summary
```

> 💡 **Tip**: Use `/history` frequently to monitor your context usage.
>
> When `Context usage` approaches 75%, the conversation is about to trigger auto-`compact`.
>
> If context exceeds the maximum limit, please report the model and `/history` logs to the community, then use `/compact` or `/new` to manage context.
>
> Token calculation logic: [ReMeInMemoryMemory implementation](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe/blob/v0.3.0.6b2/reme/memory/file_based/reme_in_memory_memory.py#L122).

---

### /message - View Single Message

View detailed content of a specific message by index.

```
/message <index>
```

**Parameters:**

- `index` - Message index number (starting from 1)

**Example:**

```
/message 1
```

**Output:**

```
**Message 1/3**

- **Timestamp:** 2024-01-15 10:30:00
- **Name:** user
- **Role:** user
- **Content:**
Write me a Python function that implements quicksort
```

---

### /compact_str - View Compressed Summary

Display the current compressed summary content.

```
/compact_str
```

**Example response (when summary exists):**

```
**Compressed Summary**

User requested help building a user authentication system, login endpoint implementation completed...
```

**Example response (when no summary):**

```
**No Compressed Summary**

- No summary has been generated yet
- Use /compact or wait for auto-compaction
```

---

### /summarize_status - View Summary Task Status

Display the running status of all background summary tasks, including task ID, start time, and execution results.

```
/summarize_status
```

**Example response:**

```
**Summary Task Status**

- **task-001**
  - Start: 2024-01-15 10:30:00
  - Status: completed
  - Result: User requested help building a user authentication system...
- **task-002**
  - Start: 2024-01-15 10:35:00
  - Status: failed
  - Error: Summary generation timeout
```

> 💡 Using `/compact` or `/new` automatically starts a summary task in the background. Use this command to check its execution status.

---

### /dump_history - Export Conversation History

Save current conversation history (including compressed summary) to a JSONL file for debugging and backup.

```
/dump_history
```

**Example response:**

```
**History Dumped!**

- Messages saved: 15
- Has summary: True
- File: `/path/to/workspace/debug_history.jsonl`
```

> 💡 **Tip**: The exported file can be used with `/load_history` to restore conversation history, or for debugging analysis.

---

### /load_history - Load Conversation History

Load conversation history from a JSONL file into current memory. **Existing memory will be cleared first**.

```
/load_history
```

**Example response:**

```
**History Loaded!**

- Messages loaded: 15
- Has summary: True
- File: `/path/to/workspace/debug_history.jsonl`
- Memory cleared before loading
```

**Notes:**

- File source: Loaded from `debug_history.jsonl` in the workspace directory
- Maximum load: 10,000 messages
- If the first message in the file contains a compressed summary marker, the summary will be restored automatically
- Current memory is **cleared before loading** — make sure to backup important content

> ⚠️ **Warning**: `/load_history` clears current memory before loading. Existing conversation will be lost!

---

## Skill Chat Commands

These commands let you inspect skill status in chat and force the agent to use
a specific skill.

- `/skills` lists skills available in the current channel in a compact format.
- `/<skill_name>` shows detailed information for that skill, including its
  description and local path.
- `/<skill_name> <input>` forces the agent to use `skill_name` to solve the
  input, usually a task.
- `/[skill_name]` is also supported as an alternate form.

Notes:

- `skill_name` must match the skill command name shown in `/skills`.
- These slash commands only work for skills that are enabled and routed to the
  current channel.

---

## System Control Commands

Commands for controlling and monitoring QwenPaw's runtime status. These commands execute directly without going through the Agent.

Send `/daemon <subcommand>` or short names (e.g., `/status`) in chat, or run `qwenpaw daemon <subcommand>` from the terminal.

| Command                             | Description                                                                               | Chat | Terminal |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | -------- |
| `/stop`                             | Immediately terminate the running task in current session                                 | ✅   | ❌       |
| `/stop session=<session_id>`        | Terminate task in specified session                                                       | ✅   | ❌       |
| `/daemon status` or `/status`       | Show runtime status (config, working directory, memory service)                           | ✅   | ✅       |
| `/daemon restart` or `/restart`     | Zero-downtime reload (chat); prints instructions (terminal)                               | ✅   | ✅       |
| `/daemon reload-config`             | Re-read and validate configuration file                                                   | ✅   | ✅       |
| `/daemon version`                   | Version number, working directory, and log path                                           | ✅   | ✅       |
| `/daemon logs` or `/daemon logs 50` | View last N lines of log (default 100, max 2000, from `qwenpaw.log` in working directory) | ✅   | ✅       |
| `/daemon approve`                   | Approve pending tool execution (tool-guard scenario)                                      | ✅   | ❌       |

---

### /stop - Stop Task

Immediately terminate the task currently executing in the session. Highest priority command that processes concurrently even when tasks are running.

**Usage:**

```
/stop                       # Stop current session's task
/stop session=<session_id>  # Stop task in specified session
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**: `/stop` immediately terminates the task, which may result in partial data loss.

---

### /daemon status or /status - View Runtime Status

Display current runtime status, including configuration, working directory, and memory service status.

**Usage:**

```
/status                    # In chat
qwenpaw daemon status        # From terminal
```

---

### /daemon restart or /restart - Zero-Downtime Reload

When used in chat, performs zero-downtime reload: reloads channels, cron, and MCP configurations without interrupting the process. Useful for applying channel or MCP configuration changes.

**Usage:**

```
/restart                   # In chat
qwenpaw daemon restart       # From terminal (prints instructions only)
```

> 💡 **Tip**: After modifying channel or MCP configuration, use `/daemon reload-config` first to verify correctness, then use `/daemon restart` to apply changes.

---

### /daemon reload-config - Reload Configuration File

Re-read and validate the configuration file, but does not reload runtime components (channels, cron, MCP). Useful for verifying configuration file changes.

**Usage:**

```
/daemon reload-config           # In chat
qwenpaw daemon reload-config      # From terminal
```

---

### /daemon version - Version Information

Display QwenPaw version number, working directory path, and log file path.

**Usage:**

```
/daemon version            # In chat
qwenpaw daemon version       # From terminal
```

---

### /daemon logs - View Logs

View the last N lines of `qwenpaw.log` in the working directory. Default 100 lines, maximum 2000 lines.

**Usage:**

```
/daemon logs               # Default 100 lines
/daemon logs 50            # Specify 50 lines
qwenpaw daemon logs -n 200   # From terminal, specify 200 lines
```

> 💡 **Tip**: For large log files, this command only reads the last 512KB from the end of the file to ensure fast response times.

---

### /daemon approve - Approve Tool Execution

Quickly approve pending tool execution. When tool execution requires manual approval (tool-guard scenario), use this command to approve.

**Usage:**

```
/daemon approve            # In chat
```

> 💡 **Tip**: This command only works in chat. When the Agent prompts for tool execution approval, send this command to quickly approve.

---

### Terminal Usage

All daemon commands support terminal usage (except `/stop` and `/daemon approve` which only work in chat):

```bash
qwenpaw daemon status
qwenpaw daemon restart
qwenpaw daemon reload-config
qwenpaw daemon version
qwenpaw daemon logs -n 50
```

**Multi-agent support:** All terminal commands support the `--agent-id` parameter (defaults to `default`).

```bash
qwenpaw daemon status --agent-id abc123
qwenpaw daemon version --agent-id abc123
```

---

## Mission Mode - Autonomous Execution for Complex Tasks

Mission Mode is an autonomous execution mode designed for **long-running, complex tasks**, inspired by [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) and [Ralph Loop](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph). It decomposes large tasks into multiple user stories and completes them through a **master agent → worker agents → verifier agents** pipeline, ensuring quality and reliability.

### Core Features

- 📋 **Two-Phase Design**: Phase 1 generates PRD (Product Requirements Document), Phase 2 executes autonomously
- 🔒 **Code-Level Control**: Master agent's implementation tools are disabled, can only dispatch workers to prevent context pollution
- ✅ **Independent Verification**: Each story is verified by a dedicated verifier agent to ensure all acceptance criteria are met
- 🔄 **Auto-Iteration**: Failed stories are automatically retried until all complete or max iterations reached
- 🌐 **Multi-Language**: Error messages automatically switch between Chinese and English based on agent config

### Use Cases

**✅ Suitable for Mission Mode:**

- Building complete feature modules (e.g., user authentication system, file manager)
- Refactoring large codebases (e.g., migrating to a new framework)
- Batch tasks (e.g., adding unit tests to multiple components)
- Tasks requiring multiple iterations and verification

**❌ Not suitable for Mission Mode:**

- Simple code changes (e.g., fixing a single bug)
- Tasks requiring real-time interaction (e.g., debugging)
- Exploratory tasks (e.g., "research best practices")

### Basic Usage

#### Start a Mission

```bash
/mission <task description>
```

**Example:**

```
/mission Create a CLI TODO app in Python with add, delete, list, and mark-complete features, saving data to local JSON file
```

**Optional Parameters:**

- `--max-iterations N`: Set max Phase 2 iterations (range 1-100, default 20)
- `--verify <command>`: Custom verification command (e.g., `pytest`)

```
/mission Create Web API --max-iterations 30 --verify "pytest tests/"
```

#### Phase 1: PRD Generation

The agent will:

1. Explore the codebase and understand existing structure
2. Decompose the task into multiple user stories
3. Generate `prd.json` file with acceptance criteria for each story

**PRD Example:**

```json
{
  "project": "todo-cli-app",
  "description": "Command-line TODO application",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "Add Task Feature",
      "description": "As a user, I want to add new tasks...",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Command 'todo add <task>' successfully adds task",
        "Task is saved to todos.json file"
      ],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Phase 2: Confirm and Execute

**Confirm PRD:**

After reviewing the PRD, send a confirmation message to enter Phase 2:

```
Confirm, start execution
```

**Or, if modifications are needed:**

```
Please split US-001 into two stories: one for adding and one for persistence
```

The agent will modify the PRD and wait for confirmation again.

**Phase 2 Execution Flow:**

1. **Master Dispatch**: Dispatches worker agents for each story
2. **Worker Implementation**: Creates/modifies files, runs tests
3. **Verifier Validation**: Independent agent verifies all acceptance criteria
4. **Update PRD**: Passed stories are marked `passes: true`
5. **Auto-Iteration**: Failed stories are re-dispatched until all complete

#### Check Progress

```bash
/mission status
```

**Output Example:**

```
**Mission Status** — mission-20260415-123456
- Session: e2e-abc123
- Phase: execution
- Project: todo-cli-app
- Progress: 2/4 stories passed
- Loop dir: ~/.copaw/workspaces/default/missions/mission-20260415-123456

  ✅ US-001: Add Task Feature
  ✅ US-002: List Tasks Feature
  ⬜ US-003: Delete Task Feature
  ⬜ US-004: Mark Complete Feature
```

#### List All Missions

```bash
/mission list
```

### Working Directory Structure

Each mission creates a working directory under `~/.copaw/workspaces/default/missions/mission-<timestamp>/`:

```
mission-20260415-123456/
├── prd.json              # Product Requirements Document
├── loop_config.json      # Configuration and state
├── task.md               # Original task description
├── progress.txt          # Progress log (Codebase Patterns)
└── <implementation files>
```

### Important Notes

1. **Session Isolation**: Each session's missions are independent and won't interfere with each other
2. **PRD Schema Validation**: Phase 2 startup enforces PRD format validation to ensure schema compliance
3. **Tool Restrictions**: In Phase 2, master agent **cannot** directly use `edit_file`, `browser_use` and other implementation tools, must delegate to workers
4. **Iteration Limit**: Automatically stops after reaching `--max-iterations` to avoid infinite loops
5. **Git Support**: If working directory is a Git repo, agent will automatically commit changes (optional)
6. **⚠️ Tool Guard Bypass**:
   - **Worker and verifier agents automatically bypass the security tool guard** (disabled via `--background` mode)
   - This is necessary because background sessions cannot respond to `/approve` interactive prompts
   - The master agent itself will also bypass the guard
   - **Security Warning**: All worker operations occur within `missions/<mission-xxx>/` directory, but it is still recommended to **only use Mission Mode in fully trusted codebases**
   - Sensitive operations (e.g., deleting files, executing shell commands) will execute directly without manual approval

### Advanced Usage

#### Custom Verification Command

```
/mission Add unit tests --verify "npm test"
```

Verification phase will run `npm test` to check if tests pass.

#### Increase Iterations (Complex Tasks)

```
/mission Refactor entire auth module --max-iterations 50
```

#### Mid-Execution Intervention

During Phase 2, you can send messages to interact with master agent:

```
Pause - US-003 implementation has issues, please fix before continuing
```

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: PRD format incorrect**

```
⚠️ **Cannot enter Phase 2**: prd.json format errors:
  - Missing required field: userStories

Please fix the PRD format before confirming.
```

**Solution**: Check `prd.json`, ensure it contains `userStories` array with required fields for each story.

**Issue: Max iterations reached**

```
⚠️ **Mission reached max iterations** (20). 2/4 stories passed.
```

**Solutions**:

1. Use `/mission status` to check remaining stories
2. Increase `--max-iterations` and restart
3. Or manually complete remaining work

### Comparison with Other Modes

| Mode             | Use Case                  | Agent Behavior                 | Tool Access              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Normal Chat**  | Simple tasks, quick fixes | Single agent executes directly | All tools available      |
| **Mission Mode** | Complex, long-term tasks  | Master dispatches workers      | Master has limited tools |

## Proactive Mode - Proactive Notification Mode

Proactive Mode is an intelligent feature that allows the AI agent to actively analyze the user's current session context and screen activities after detecting that the user has been inactive for a prolonged period, and provide relevant assistance and information.

### Core Features

- 🤖 **Intelligent Detection**: Monitors session activity status and triggers when inactivity is detected for a set period
- 🧠 **Context Analysis**: Analyzes user's conversation history and current screen content to identify potential needs
- 🔍 **Goal Extraction**: Extracts topics that the user may be focusing on from conversation history
- 💬 **Proactive Response**: Generates helpful and relevant proactive messages based on analysis results

### Important Notice

**Please be aware of the following risks before enabling this mode:**

- **Tool Protection Bypass**: In this mode, the Agent **bypasses standard tool protection mechanisms**. This means the Agent has higher system privileges and execution freedom.
- **Privacy and Environment Access**: The Agent **reads historical session memory** to understand context and **may take screenshots** to obtain current runtime environment information. Please ensure use in a trusted environment and protect sensitive information.
- This mode is **disabled by default**. It only takes effect when actively enabled by the user and can be disabled after being turned on.

### Basic Usage

#### Enable Proactive Mode

```bash
/proactive
/proactive on
/proactive <minutes>
```

**Example:**

```bash
/proactive      # Default 30 minutes, trigger proactive notification after 30 minutes of inactivity
/proactive on   # Same as above, default 30 minutes
/proactive 60   # Trigger proactive notification after 60 minutes
```

#### Disable Proactive Mode

```bash
/proactive off
```

### How It Works

1. **Monitoring Phase**: Continuously monitors user activity, recording the last activity timestamp
2. **Analysis Phase**: When inactivity exceeding the set time is detected, analyzes recent conversation history
3. **Task Extraction**: Identifies topics the user may be concerned about
4. **Query Execution**: Uses tools like browser, file reading, command execution to obtain relevant information
5. **Response Generation**: Generates friendly and relevant proactive assistance information

#### Context Awareness

- Focuses only on user-initiated messages, ignoring system messages
- Avoids repeatedly sending proactive messages on the same topics
- Prioritizes frequent and recently mentioned topics

### Important Notes

1. **Resource Consumption**: Enables regular context analysis after activation, which may increase computational resource usage
2. **Distraction Control**: If the user does not respond to proactive messages, no consecutive proactive messages will be sent
3. **Model Dependency**: Function effectiveness depends on the AI model capability used; multimodal-enabled models can better utilize screen analysis features

### Typical Use Cases

- New information acquisition during research processes
- Supplementary knowledge provision during learning processes
