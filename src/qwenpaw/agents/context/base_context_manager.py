    """Abstract base class defining the context manager interface.

    All context manager backends must implement this interface to be usable
    as a drop-in replacement within the workspace.

    Concrete implementations are responsible for managing the *active*
    conversation context window, including:
    - **Compaction**: condensing older messages into a rolling summary when
      the context approaches the model's token limit.
    - **Tool-result pruning**: trimming oversized tool outputs inline so
      they do not exhaust the context budget unnecessarily.
    - **Context health checks**: deciding whether and what to compact before
      each agent step.

    The typical lifecycle mirrors ``BaseMemoryManager``:
        1. Instantiate with ``working_dir`` and ``agent_id``.
        2. Call ``await start()`` to connect to the backing store.
        3. Use the lifecycle hooks (``pre_reasoning``, ``post_acting``, etc.)
           during the agent loop.
        4. Call ``await close()`` to flush state and release resources.

    Attributes:
        working_dir: Root directory used for any on-disk context storage
            (e.g. compaction indices, cached summaries).
        agent_id: Unique identifier of the owning agent, used for config
            loading and storage namespacing.
